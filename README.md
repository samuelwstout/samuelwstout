Software engineer with 2 years of professional experience specializing in full stack engineering with TypeScript, React, React Native, Node, and Next.js.

During my time at Red Foundry, I built products from the ground up across various client projects, taking ownership and independently managing responsibility throughout the development lifecycle. Working across diverse software consulting projects has equipped me with a breadth of engineering skills and the ability to deliver effective solutions in varied technical environments.

I enjoy approaching engineering challenges from a wireframe-first perspective, ensuring technical implementations align with real user needs. Currently building an LLM browser automation side project while seeking new opportunities to apply my full stack engineering skills.
